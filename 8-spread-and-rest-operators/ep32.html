      // The exact opposite of the spread operator
      // where it takes elements of an array and unpacks them
      // the rest param takes params and packs them into an array.
      // in a function or a construction

      function convertCurrency(rate, ...amounts) {
        // instead of arguments object,
        // we don't know what the difference is with the first param
        // and the *rest*!
        return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate);
      }

      const amounts = convertCurrency(1.54, 10, 23, 52, 1, 56);
      console.log(amounts);

      // amounts is a true array, not an array like arguments object


      // When used with destructuring:

      const runner = ['Kelv', 123, 5.5, 5, 3, 6, 35];
      // Destructure assuming first is name, then ID and rest are their run
      // distances

      // pack the rest into the runs array
      const [name, id, ...runs] = runner;
      console.log(name, id, runs);

      // From earlier example of team players:
      const team = ['Wes', 'Kait', 'Lux', 'Sheena', 'Kelly'];
      const [captain, assistant, ...players] = team;
      console.log(captain, assistant, players);
